## FAQs

- Why is it so slow?  
  Whenever you request info about a movie/show on libremdb, 4 trips are made(2 between your browser and libremdb's server, and 2 between libremdb's server and IMDb's server) instead of the usual 2 trips when you visit a website. For this reason there's a noticable delay. This is a bit of inconvenience you'll have to face should you wish to use this website.

- It doesn't have all routes.  
  I think most of the people just check IMDb to get a quick glimpse of a movie/show. That's why there is just one route for now. However, I will try to implement other important routes if time allows. Keep an eye on [To-Do](#to-do) section.

- Why is it connecting to `m.media-amazon.com`?  
  For now, images are directly served from amazon. If I have enough time in the future, I'll implement a way to serve the images from libremdb instead.

- Will amazon track me then?  
  They may log your IP address. I'd recommend using a VPN for mitigating this risk.

- Why not just use IMDb?  
  Refer to the [features section](#features) above.
- Why didn't you use other databases like [TMDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) or [OMDb](https://www.omdbapi.com/)?  
  IMDb simply has superior dataset compared to all other alternatives. With that being said, I'd encourage you to check out those alternatives too.

## Privacy

In short: libremdb doesn't collect any data at all.

- Data you directly provide: None.
- Data you passively provide: A stack trace is logged to console on the server if you hit some error route.
- Data stored in your browser: To remember theme preferences, the website stores a key named 'theme' in Local Storage provided by your browser. Apart from that, there is nothing stored in your browser.
- Data collected by other services: libremdb connects to `m.media-amazon.com` for fetching images. So, Amazon might log your IP address. If you use the official instance which is deployed on Heroku, then Heroku might also log you IP address. You're advised to follow due precaution.
